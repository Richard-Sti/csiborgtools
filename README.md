# CSiBORG analysis tools :dart:

## TODO :scroll:
:robot_face:
- [x] Read in as float32 instead of float16? Especially positions.
- [x] Try to fit a halo.
- [ ] Sort out output after fitting halos.
- [ ] Write a function that calculates M500.
- [ ] Calculate the cross-correlation in CSiBORG. Should see the scale of the constraints?
- [ ] Fully debug `dump_split_particles`


## Open questions :bulb:
- Get uncertainty on the fitted $R_{\rm s}$? If so get this directly from JAX.
