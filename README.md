# CSiBORG tools

## :scroll: Short-term TODO
- [ ] Find the distribution of particles in the first snapshot
- [ ] Make sure I am not taking halos outside of the well-resolved region.
- [ ] Implement a custom model for matchin galaxies to halos.


## :hourglass: Long-term TODO
- [ ] Calculate the halo spin.
- [ ] Calculate the cross-correlation in CSiBORG. Should see the scale of the constraints?
- [ ] Calculate DM environmental properties.


## :bulb: Open questions
- What scaling of the search region? No reason for it to be a multiple of $R_{200c}$.
