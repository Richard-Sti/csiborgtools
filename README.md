# CSiBORG tools

## Short-term TODO
- [ ] Figure out how to visualise the `Pylians` power spectra.
- [ ] Get `powmes` working and compare its power spectrum to `Pylians`.
- [x] Calculate the cross-correlation with `Pylians`
- [x] Check alignment of the angular momentum
- [x] Make sure I am not taking halos outside of the well-resolved region.
- [x] Calculate the gravitational potential.
- [x] Add the gravitational field calculation.


## Long-term TODO
- [ ] Calculate the cross-correlation in CSiBORG. Should see the scale of the constraints?
- [ ] Find the distribution of particles in the first snapshot
- [ ] Implement a custom model for matchin galaxies to halos.
- [x] Calculate DM environmental properties.


## Open questions
- What scaling of the search region? No reason for it to be a multiple of $R_{200c}$.
- Begin extracting the DM environmental properties at galaxy positions?
