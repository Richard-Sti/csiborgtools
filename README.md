# CSiBORG Tools

Tools for analysing the suite of Constrained Simulations in BORG (CSiBORG) simulations.

The interface is designed to work with the following suites of simulations:
- CSiBORG1 dark matter-only RAMSES simulations (full support)
- CSiBORG2 dark matter-only Gadget4 simulations (adding support in progress)
- Quijote dark matter-only Gadget2 simulations (partial support)


## TODO
We need to add support for CSiBORG2
