## :scroll: Short-term TODO
- [x] Add the X-ray clusters
- [x] Match the X-ray clusters to Planck
- [ ] Calculate catalogues for all realisations.
- [ ] Implement Max's halo matching


## :hourglass: Long-term TODO
- [ ] Calculate the halo spin.
- [ ] Calculate the cross-correlation in CSiBORG. Should see the scale of the constraints?
- [ ] Calculate DM environmental properties.


## :bulb: Open questions
- Completeness of clusters. Optical clusters catalogues are a bit of a mess..
