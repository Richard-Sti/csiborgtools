# CSiBORGTools


### Questions
- How well can observed clusters be matched to CSiBORG? Do their masses agree?
- Is the number of clusters in CSiBORG consistent?

## CSiBORG Galaxy Environmental Dependence

### TODO
- [ ] Add gradient and Hessian of the overdensity field.


### Questions
- Environmental dependence of:
  - $M_*$, colour and SFR.
  - Galaxy alignment.
  - HI content.

- Fields to calculate:
    1. Overdensity field $\delta$
    2. Gradient and Hessian of $\delta$
    3. Gravitational field $\Phi$
    4. Gradient and Hessian of $\Phi$
