# CSiBORG analysis tools :dart:

## TODO :scroll:
- [ ] Calculate $M_{\rm vir}, R_{\rm vir}, c$ from $R_s, \rho_0, \ldots$
- [ ] Calculate $M_{\rm 500c}$ by sphere shrinking
- [ ] Calculate the cross-correlation in CSiBORG. Should see the scale of the constraints?
- [ ] Improve file naming system


## Open questions :bulb:
- Get uncertainty on the fitted $R_{\rm s}$? If so get this directly from JAX.
