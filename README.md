# CSiBORG Analysis


##  Project Overlap
- [x] Test the mmain calculation
- [x] Add a new mmain calculation script
- [x] Fix pathing to initmatch
- [x] Fix the split halo calculation

- [ ] Clear up split and fit calculation. Instead of splitting dump each halo individually.
- [ ] Add incorporating the new mmain files.
- [ ] Make a split between mmain and subclump catalogues? If so, calculate overlaps only for mmain?
- [ ] Correct for what halos calculating properties. Do both?
- [ ] Make splits for parent halos so that we can calculate their properties.


- [ ] Calculate the overlap between all 101 IC realisations on DiRAC.



## Project Clustering

### Longterm
- [ ] Add uncertainty to the kNN-CDF autocorrelation?
- [ ] Add reading halo catalogues at higher redshifts.


### April 9 2023 Sunday
- [x] Add normalised marks calculation.
- [x] Add normalised marks to the submission scripts.
- [x] Verify analytical formula for the kNN of a uniform field.
- [x] For the cross-correlation try making the second field randoms.
- [x] Clean up the reader code.
- [x] Correct the crossing script.
- [x] Get started with the 2PCF calculation.

## Project Environmental Dependence
- [ ] Add gradient and Hessian of the overdensity field.
