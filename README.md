# CSiBORG tools

## Questions to answer
- How well can observed clusters be matched to CSiBORG? Do their masses agree?
- Is the number of clusters in CSiBORG consistent?
- Are any observed clusters suspiciously missing in CSiBORG?


## Short-term TODO
- [x] Add code to calculate the cross-correlation for resolved region only.
- [ ] Calculate the spectra for all 101 boxes and visualise them.
- [ ] See about the $z=70$ particles.


## Long-term TODO
- [ ] Calculate the cross-correlation in CSiBORG. Should see the scale of the constraints?
- [ ] Find the distribution of particles in the first snapshot
- [ ] Implement a custom model for matchin galaxies to halos.


## Open questions
- What scaling of the search region? No reason for it to be a multiple of $R_{200c}$.
- Begin extracting the DM environmental properties at galaxy positions?
