# CSiBORG Tools

Tools for analysing the suite of Constrained Simulations in BORG (CSiBORG) simulations. The interface is designed to work with the following suites of simulations:
- CSiBORG1 dark matter-only RAMSES simulations (full support),
- CSiBORG2 dark matter-only Gadget4 simulations (planned full support),
- Quijote dark matter-only Gadget2 simulations (partial support),
however with little effort it can support other simulations as well.


## TODO
- [x] Prune old CSiBORG1 merger tree things.
- [ ] Add visualiastion of the density field.
- [ ] Add full support for CSiBORG2 suite of simulations.
- [ ] Add SPH field calculation from cosmotools.


## Adding a new simulation suite
